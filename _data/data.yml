        details: |
          - Set up Kubernetes clusters using Kind for testing phases, followed by integrating kubectl to interact with the kube-apiserver once the cluster was configured.
          - Gained an in-depth understanding of the Kubernetes environment, including low-level networking and high-level aspects, particularly its network architecture involving pod-to-pod, service-to-pod, and external-to-service networking.
          - Installed a non-standalone version of Kubeflow for ML workflows.
          - Created custom Docker images for Kubeflow notebooks and designed machine learning pipelines (data ingestion, processing, training, deployment to the model registry, and serving with KServe or Plumber) using the Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) SDK.
          - Conducted hyperparameter tuning of models using Katib.
          - Built an architecture for batch inference (real-time inference with an online feature store was not completed).
          - Registered models and datasets as artifacts using MinIO bucket storage integrated with Kubeflow.
          - Deployed an inference service using KServe, with client-side requests executed via Kubeflow notebooks.
          - Developed a comprehensive understanding of Kubeflow's architecture and various use cases.
